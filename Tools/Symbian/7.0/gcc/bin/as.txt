  --MD FILE	          write dependency information in FILE (default none)
  -nocpp		  ignored
  -o OBJFILE	          name the object-file output OBJFILE (default a.out)
  -R		          fold data section into text section
  --statistics	          print various measured statistics from execution
  --strip-local-absolute  strip local absolute symbols

  --version		  print assembler version number and exit
  -W			  suppress warnings
  --itbl INSTTBL	  extend instruction set to include instructions
			  matching the specifications defined in file INSTTBL
  -w			  ignored
  -X			  ignored
  -Z			  generate object file even after errors
  --listing-lhs-width	  set the width in words of the output data column of
			  the listing
  --listing-lhs-width2	  set the width in words of the continuation lines
			  of the output data column; ignored if smaller than
			  the width of the first line
  --listing-rhs-width	  set the max width in characters of the lines from
			  the source file
  --listing-cont-lines	  set the maximum number of continuation lines used
			  for the output data column of the listing
